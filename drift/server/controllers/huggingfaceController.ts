  const enhancementPrompt = `You are a goal enhancement specialist. Your task is to rewrite user goals to be more specific, actionable, and measurable.

ENHANCEMENT RULES:
1. Extract specific numbers, weights, timeframes, current state
2. Add quantifiable metrics and measurements
3. Include progression strategies relevant to the category
4. Remove vague language like "I want to" and replace with specific targets
5. Emphasize the core action/skill being developed
6. Add context about experience level if mentioned
7. Make the goal more compelling and focused

CATEGORY-SPECIFIC ENHANCEMENTS:

FITNESS GOALS:
- Extract current weight/performance and target
- Add specific exercise names and rep ranges
- Include progression increments (e.g., "increase by 5kg weekly")
- Mention technique focus and supporting exercises
- Add nutrition/recovery considerations

STUDY GOALS:
- Specify exact skills, topics, or knowledge areas
- Add measurable outcomes (test scores, certifications)
- Include practice frequency and study methods
- Mention specific resources or materials

WORK GOALS:
- Define specific skills, projects, or achievements
- Add career progression metrics
- Include networking and skill development
- Mention timeline and measurable deliverables

LIFE GOALS:
- Quantify financial, health, or personal targets
- Add specific habits and behaviors
- Include tracking methods and milestones
- Mention support systems or resources needed

EXAMPLES:

Original: "I want to deadlift 300kg, im currently at 270kg, quite expereinced"

  CORRECT FORMAT RULES:
  - DayOfWeek MonthName DayNumber|task1|task2|task3;###
  - Each task must be specific and actionable
  - Include exact quantities, numbers, measurements
  - Use action verbs: Eat, Consume, Track, Complete, Perform, Practice, Write, etc.
  - Each line MUST end with semicolon followed by ###

  WRONG FORMATS (DO NOT USE):
  Monday, July 22|Review syllabus|Take practice quiz;
  Mon Jul 22|Read about nutrition; Learn protein calculation;
  Monday, July 22|Study muscle building;Complete exercises;
  Mon Jul 22|Study muscle building;Take practice quiz|###;

  STRICT RULES - NO EXCEPTIONS:
  1. Start output immediately with first day
  2. NO introductions, headers, explanations, notes, or concluding statements
  3. NO markdown (**bold**, ###headers, etc.)
  4. NO bullet points or dashes
  5. NO week sections or groupings
  6. Each line MUST end with semicolon followed by ###
  7. Tasks based on intensity: Casual=2 tasks, Moderate=3 tasks, Intense=4 tasks
  8. DayOfWeek MonthName DayNumber|task1|task2|task3;###
  9. MUST generate exactly ${totalDays} consecutive days
  10. MUST cover ALL dates from ${todayDate} to ${endDate}
  11. BE PRACTICAL: Give direct actions to DO, not things to read or learn about
  12. BE ACTIONABLE: Use implementation verbs like "Eat", "Calculate", "Consume", "Do", "Perform", "Track"
  13. BE SPECIFIC: Include exact quantities, foods, exercises, measurements
  14. FOCUS ON GOAL: All tasks must directly support the specific goal: "${enhancedGoal}"
  15. NO GENERIC LEARNING: Don't assign reading, studying, or research tasks
